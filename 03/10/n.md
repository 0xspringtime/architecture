 - Every pointer has an associated type. This type indicates what kind of object the pointer points to.  
 - Every pointer has a value. This value is an address of some object of the designated type
 - Pointers are created with the `&' operator. This operator can be applied to any C expression that is categorized as an lvalue, meaning an expression that can appear on the left side of an assignment. Examples include variables and the elements of structures, unions, and arrays
 - Pointers are dereferenced with the `*' operator. The result is a value having the type associated with the pointer
 - Arrays and pointers are closely related. The name of an array can be referenced (but not updated) as if it were a pointer variable
 - Casting from one type of pointer to another changes its type but not its value
 - Pointers can also point to functions
